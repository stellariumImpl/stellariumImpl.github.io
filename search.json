\\alpha \\cdot abla J(\\theta)$$ 批量梯度下降 BGD描述：批量梯度下降在每次迭代时使用整个数据集计算损失函数的梯度，从而更新模型参数。由于考虑了所有样本，梯度方向更准确，下降过程更稳定，适合数据量较小的情况。计算量较大，内存需求较高，尤其在大数据集上可能导致计算效率低下。 数学表达：假设数据集有 $m$ 个样本，特征矩阵为 $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$，目标向量为 $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$，参数为 $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$，损失函数为均方误差：$$J(\\theta) \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$其中 $h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) x^{(i)T} \\theta$ 是模型预测。 梯度为：$$ abla J(\\theta) \\frac{1}{m} X^T (X\\theta - y)$$参数更新公式：$$\\theta : \\theta - \\alpha abla J(\\theta) \\theta - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{1}{m} X^T (X\\theta - y)$$其中 $\\alpha$ 是学习率。 优点： 梯度计算准确，优化路径平滑，能稳定收敛到全局最优（对于凸优化问题）或较好的局部最优（非凸问题）。 适合小型数据集，内存占用可控。 每次迭代的梯度基于全体样本，噪声较小。 缺点： 计算复杂度高，时间和内存成本随数据集规模线性增长（每次迭代需要计算整个 $X^T (X\\theta - y)$）。 对于大规模数据集，计算效率低，可能不适合实时或在线学习。 如果数据集有冗余样本，计算全部样本的梯度可能带来不必要的开销。 适用场景： 数据量较小（几百到几千条样本）。 模型复杂度不高，计算资源充足。 需要稳定的收敛路径和较高的优化精度。 随机梯度下降 SGD描述：随机梯度下降在每次迭代时随机选择一个样本计算梯度并更新参数。由于只使用单个样本，计算速度快，内存占用低，非常适合大规模数据集和高维特征。更新频率高，可能在较少的迭代次数内找到较优解，但由于梯度基于单个样本，方向波动较大，优化路径可能震荡，难以精准收敛到全局最优，容易陷入局部最优或鞍点。 数学表达：对于单个样本 $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$，损失函数为：$$J^{(i)}(\\theta) \\frac{1}{2} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$梯度为：$$ abla J^{(i)}(\\theta) (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)} (x^{(i)T} \\theta - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}$$参数更新公式：$$\\theta : \\theta - \\alpha abla J^{(i)}(\\theta) \\theta - \\alpha (x^{(i)T} \\theta - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}$$每次迭代随机选择一个样本 $i \\in {1, 2, \\dots, m}$。 优点： 计算效率高，每次迭代只处理一个样本，适合大规模数据集（百万级甚至亿级样本）。 内存占用低，无需加载整个数据集到内存。 高频更新使得参数能快速调整，可能更快地逼近最优解，尤其在早期迭代。 梯度噪声有时有助于逃离局部最优或鞍点（在非凸优化中可能有益）。 缺点： 梯度波动大，优化路径不稳定，可能在最优解附近震荡，难以精准收敛。 对学习率 $\\alpha$ 敏感，需仔细调参或使用自适应学习率（如 Adam 优化器）。 可能陷入局部最优或鞍点，尤其在复杂的非凸问题中。 收敛速度可能因噪声而变慢，尤其在后期。 适用场景： 大规模数据集（如深度学习中的图像、文本数据）。 在线学习或流式数据场景，数据不断到来。 计算资源有限，需高效利用内存和时间。 模型训练需要快速迭代，早期收敛比精准收敛更重要。 Mini-Batch Gradient Descent补充说明：在实际应用中，小批量梯度下降 (Mini-Batch GD) 是一种折中的方法，结合了 BGD 和 SGD 的优点。它每次迭代使用一小批样本（通常是几十到几百个）计算梯度，平衡了计算效率和梯度稳定性。 数学表达：假设小批量大小为 $b$，随机选择一个批次 $B {i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_b}$，损失函数为：$$J_B(\\theta) \\frac{1}{2b} \\sum_{i \\in B} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$梯度为：$$ abla J_B(\\theta) \\frac{1}{b} \\sum_{i \\in B} (x^{(i)T} \\theta - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}$$参数更新公式：$$\\theta : \\theta - \\alpha abla J_B(\\theta)$$ 优点： 兼顾 BGD 的稳定性和 SGD 的高效性，梯度波动适中。 适合 GPU 并行计算，深度学习中常用。 小批量大小可调，灵活性高。 缺点： 小批量大小 $b$ 需调参，过大接近 BGD，过小接近 SGD。 仍需加载小批量数据到内存，对超大规模数据可能仍有压力。 适用场景： 深度学习（几乎所有神经网络训练都使用 Mini-Batch GD）。 数据量中等偏大，计算资源支持并行计算。 需要平衡收敛速度和稳定性。"},{"title":"决策树","path":"/COMP9417/10.Decision Tree/index.html","content":"ID3使用信息增益，偏向于特征值多的属性 无剪枝，容易过拟合 仅用于分类问题，构建多叉树 只能处理离散型特征，对缺失值敏感 每个特征只能在一条路径中使用一次 C4.5使用信息增益率，克服信息增益偏差，偏向于特征取值少的属性 悲观剪枝，基于误差率估计 仅用于分类问题，构建多叉树 支持连续与离散特征，能处理缺失值 每个特征只能在一条路径中使用一次 CART使用基尼指数，避免使用对数函数，偏向于特征取值多的属性 代价复杂度剪枝，考虑损失与复杂度的平衡 用于分类和回归问题，构建二叉树 支持连续与离散特征，能处理缺失值 同一特征可以重复使用于不同层级 三种决策树总结小样本推荐使用C4.5，大样本推荐使用CART（C4.5多次扫描排序，CART更适用于统计大样本） 回归树划分标准：使用均方误差 MSE，所有可能划分点中，选择加权平均 MSE最小的点作为最优划分点。 多变量划分策略：每个属性单独找最优划分点，对于每个属性的划分，计算 Weighted Average Variance，选择加权方差最小的属性与划分点。 类似于分类树使用信息增益衡量纯度，这里只不过使用 方差减少替代。 回归树容易在训练集上过拟合，尤其是当继续划分会导致每个叶节点样本极少时。 模型树跟回归树很类似，唯一不同，叶节点不是一个常数，而是线性模型（比如线性回归） 模型树结构仍为决策树，但是每个叶子拟合的是$yw_0+w_1x_1+w_2x_2+…$ 优点是精度高，线性模型适应性强，能提高预测能力，计算快，仅在叶子结点拟合线性模型，不需要全树建模，可解释性好，每个区域一个线性回归方程，清晰明了 划分标准是标准差减少 SDR Standard Deviation Reduction 用于衡量划分后子集是否变得更集中 划分终止条件为 子集标准差小于全局标准差的某一比例 或者叶子结点样本树小于某个阈值 模型树相较于回归树更容易过拟合，因为拟合能力更强"}]
